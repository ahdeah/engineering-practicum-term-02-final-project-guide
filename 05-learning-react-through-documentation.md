# 🚀 Learning React through Documentation

## 📌 Introduction

Before we implement our user interface, we want to make sure we understand the core concepts of our UI library. To do this, we are going to exercise a few of our software engineering learning techniques: Reading documentation, reading internet people's code and copying it (documentation tutorials), AI-augmented research, and sitting down and building projects.

React has what I would consider relatively high-quality documentation. It's well-organized, and they provide comprehensive tutorials that cover the core concepts that you'll need to use on a daily basis.

So we will use this documentation to ensure we understand and can apply the core concepts before building our own frontend.

This means we won't be touching our final project in VSCode until we finish these steps 😊

## 📌 Learning Path

### 🔹 To-do List

1️⃣ **Read quick start for comprehension**
   - 🔗 [React Documentation Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
   - "This page will give you an introduction to 80% of the React concepts that you will use on a daily basis."
   - You don't need to code along to this one.

   #### 💡 Key Practices:
   - Start to correlate the code with how components are represented in the UI. Eventually, you want to be able to read code for creating UIs and imagine what it will look like on the screen in your mind's eye.
   - Take time to understand what you don't already know. If there are words that are unclear to you, don't just skip over them. Research what they mean. Use all of the tools that are available to you (Perplexity, YouTube, Google search). Now is a really important time to do that. If you need to, ask perplexity to explain things to you as if you're 10 years old! I do that all the time 😁

2️⃣ **Complete the tic tac toe tutorial**
   - 🔗 [React Tic Tac Toe Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

   #### 💡 Key Practices:
   - You do need to make your own copy of this project and code along with the tutorial.
   - Get comfortable writing in the React style. Do not copy and paste here. Write everything manually.
   - Fill in your gaps in understanding. If you write a line of code and it does what it should but you don't understand why, look it up. Use your tools to find an explanation that you understand.

> 🚨 **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT MOVE FORWARD UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE STEPS ABOVE

Once you've completed these steps we can begin to apply "thinking in React" to our own UIs we designed in the form of wireframes.

> 🎯 **Success!** After completing both the quick start guide and the tic-tac-toe tutorial, you'll have a solid foundation in React fundamentals that will prepare you for building your own application.
