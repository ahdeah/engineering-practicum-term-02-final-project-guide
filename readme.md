# 🚀 Welcome to Your Second Final Project for Engineering Practicum!

## 📌 Building on Your Foundation

Last term we focused on understanding, practicing, and applying the basic concepts within:
- Computational thinking
- Algorithmic programming
- Exploratory data analysis with Python

That culminated in your [first final project](https://github.com/CoachAsim/engineering-practicum-term-01-final-project-guide/tree/main).

## 📌 This Term's Focus

This term we've developed our:
- Autodidactic learning skills
- Web application development through the PERN stack

## 📌 The Next Level: Interactive Web Application

This term's final project will be a **second iteration** of your first term project! 

Instead of just running a Python program in your terminal, you will be **locally hosting an interactive web application** complete with:
- A frontend Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- A server
- A database

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to allow the users of your webapp to:
- Perform all of the same data analysis that was possible in your Python program
- Access data that now comes from a database
- Interact with your website to select different analyses and visualizations

> 💡 **Tip:** Think about how you can make your web interface intuitive and engaging for users while maintaining all the analytical capabilities of your original Python project!

## 📌 Guide Files - Follow in This Order

> 🚨 **IMPORTANT:** Please follow these guides in the exact order listed below:

### 🔍 Step 1: Planning & Requirements
```
📄 Application Development Process
```
Make your own copy of this [Application Development Process doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IbGfnUIK9k9XhPexmdK_cE6U8znBVWdbUg5chCSC_YY/edit?usp=sharing) and **complete all steps** before moving on.

### 💻 Step 2: Setting Up Your Server
```
📄 01-node-server-and-express-endpoints-starter.md
```
Proceed to the [Node Server & Express Endpoints Starter guide](01-node-server-and-express-endpoints-starter.md) to create your backend foundation.

### 📊 Step 3: Database Connection
```
📄 02-connecting-server-to-db.md
```
Follow the [Connecting Server to DB guide](02-connecting-server-to-db.md) to link your server with your PostgreSQL database.

### 🎨 Step 4: Frontend Setup
```
📄 03-frontend-setup-create-react-app.md
```
Use the [Frontend Setup guide](03-frontend-setup-create-react-app.md) to create your React application.

### 🔌 Step 5: Connecting Frontend to Backend
```
📄 04-frontend-backend-connection.md
```
Learn how to connect your React frontend to your Express backend with the [Frontend-Backend Connection guide](04-frontend-backend-connection.md).

### 📚 Step 6: Learning React
```
📄 05-learning-react-through-documentation.md
```
Follow the [Learning React guide](05-learning-react-through-documentation.md) to build a solid foundation in React concepts.

### 🧩 Step 7: Thinking in React
```
📄 06-thinking-in-react.md
```
Apply the [Thinking in React guide](06-thinking-in-react.md) to break down your UI into components and build your frontend with placeholder data.

### 🔄 Step 8: Implementing the Complete Data Journey
```
📄 07a-data-journey-overview.md
📄 07b-database-layer.md
📄 07c-server-processing-endpoints.md
📄 07d-frontend-data-fetching.md
```
Follow these guides to implement the complete data journey in your application:
Note: Use [Data Journey Checklist](data-journey-checklist.md) to keep yourself on track : )

1. Start with the [Data Journey Overview](07a-data-journey-overview.md) to understand how data flows from your database to the user interface

2. Explore the [Database Layer](07b-database-layer.md) to understand your PostgreSQL data structure and write effective queries

3. Learn how to implement [Server-Side Processing and API Endpoints](07c-server-processing-endpoints.md) that transform raw data into the format your frontend needs

4. Complete the journey with [Frontend Data Fetching](07d-frontend-data-fetching.md) to bring real data from your API into your React components

Following this sequence will ensure you build your application in a logical, step-by-step manner.

## 📌 The Importance of Reading Thoroughly

> 💡 **Hey future developers!** One of the most valuable skills in software engineering is the ability to read and follow documentation carefully. 

When working with new technologies, frameworks, or joining a new development team, thorough reading is your superpower! Take your time with these guides - read every section, understand the concepts, and follow each step completely before moving on.

Many bugs and issues can be avoided simply by reading the docs carefully. This project is great practice for developing this essential professional skill! 

Remember: even senior developers spend a significant portion of their time reading documentation. It's not just about coding fast - it's about coding smart! 🧠✨
