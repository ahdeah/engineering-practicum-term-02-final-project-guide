# ðŸš€ Data Journey Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to track your progress through implementing the complete data journey from your database to your user interface. Each section builds on the previous one, so complete them in order.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Understanding the Data Journey (07a)

- [ ] Read the complete data journey overview
- [ ] Understand the flow: Database â†’ Server â†’ Frontend â†’ UI
- [ ] Review your current static data implementation
- [ ] Identify which visualizations need real data
- [ ] Plan how each visualization's data needs to be structured

## ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Database Layer (07b)

- [ ] Examine your PostgreSQL data structure
- [ ] Understand the columns and data types in your table(s)
- [ ] Write and test basic queries to retrieve your data
- [ ] Create filtered queries for specific visualizations
- [ ] Develop aggregation queries for summary statistics
- [ ] Test your queries in psql or another database tool
- [ ] Understand the response format from the db.query function

## ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Server-Side Processing & API Endpoints (07c)

- [ ] Create a RESTful API endpoint for each visualization
- [ ] Implement data transformation logic for each endpoint:
  - [ ] Site comparison data (Bar Chart)
  - [ ] Time trends data (Line Chart)
  - [ ] Geographic data (Map)
- [ ] Add proper error handling to each endpoint
- [ ] Format dates, numbers, and arrays consistently
- [ ] Test each endpoint using Postman
- [ ] Verify that the response format matches what your frontend needs

## ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Frontend Data Fetching (07d)

- [ ] Update each visualization component to fetch real data:
  - [ ] Replace static data in Bar Chart component
  - [ ] Replace random data in Line Chart component
  - [ ] Replace hardcoded station data in Map component
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add error handling for failed API requests
- [ ] Transform API response data into the format your charts expect
- [ ] Test your components with the real data
- [ ] Ensure visualizations look correct with the real data

## ðŸ“Œ Final Verification

- [ ] All components are fetching data from their respective endpoints
- [ ] Loading indicators show while data is being fetched
- [ ] Error messages display when something goes wrong
- [ ] Visualizations render correctly with the real data
- [ ] The application runs without console errors
- [ ] Database queries are efficient and properly filtered
- [ ] Data transformations on the server are working correctly

---

ðŸŽ‰ When you've checked off all these items, you've successfully implemented the complete data journey in your application! Your visualizations now display real, dynamic data from your database.

Remember, this is one of the most important aspects of your application - connecting real data to interactive visualizations is what makes your application useful and insightful for users.
